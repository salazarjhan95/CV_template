%Mountains have played a pivotal role in shaping ecological and evolutionary patterns for various groups of organisms, rendering them ideal subjects for studying adaptation and evolution patterns. My research centers on unraveling the intricacies of evolution within mountainous terrains, with a specific focus on anole speciesâ€”a genus of neotropical lizards distinguished by a flag-like appendix on their neck. I am particularly intrigued by understanding how these anole species have evolved to adapt and diversify across the varying elevations of the Colombian Andes.
